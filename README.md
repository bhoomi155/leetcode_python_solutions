## Problem Format

Each solution file contains:

- Problem Name
- Approach / Intuition
- Python Solution
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- Key Learning

### Example

```python
# LeetCode 35
# Search Insert Position

class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1

        while l <= r:
            m = (l + r) // 2

            if nums[m] == target:
                return m
            elif nums[m] < target:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m - 1

        return l
```

**Time Complexity:** O(log n)

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Key Learning:** Binary Search can be used not only to find an element but also to determine its correct insertion position.
